I am currently a quantitative researcher at [Two Sigma Investments](https://www.twosigma.com). I received my PhD in the [Department of Management Science & Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu) at Stanford University. I'm fortunately advised by [Ramesh Johari](http://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/) and [Jose Blanchet](https://web.stanford.edu/~jblanche/) and mentored by [Peter Glynn](https://web.stanford.edu/~glynn/). I am also a member of [Operations Resarch](https://or.stanford.edu) group in MS&E.

My research interest is mainly on experimental design for online platforms, using techniques from stochastic modeling and concepts from causal inference to extract actionable insights for practitioners. I am also interested in applying techniques from operations research and probability to market matching problems.

Before coming to Stanford, I completed a Bachelor degree in Engineering and a Bachelor degree in Economics from Peking University, during which I worked on stochastic simulation with [Chenxu Li](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=cxli) from Guanghua School of Management and healthcare management with [Jie Song](https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultyaz/891230.htm) from the College of Engineering.

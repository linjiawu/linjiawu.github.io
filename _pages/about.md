I am a 4th year PhD student in the Department of Management Science & Engineering at Stanford University. I am fortunately advised by [Ramesh Johari](http://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/) and [Jose Blanchet](https://web.stanford.edu/~jblanche/).

My research interest is mainly on experiment design for online platforms, using techniques from stochastic modeling and concepts from causal inference. I am also interested in applying techniques from operations research and probability to market matching problems.

Before coming to Stanford, I completed a Bachelor degree in Engineering and a Bachelor degree in Economics from Peking University, during which I worked with [Chenxu Li](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=cxli) from Guanghua School of Management and [Jie Song](https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultyaz/891230.htm) from College of Engineering.
